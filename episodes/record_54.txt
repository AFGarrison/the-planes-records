<p>While this contract was of less consequence and more quickly handled than many before it, it nonetheless left an impression on me, as it was the first time I visited the Outlands. Like most people in the kingdom, I had little reason to travel that far Northwest, and the whispers about the things that could kill you in the Outlands had been enough thus far to persuade me to avoid any recreational travel in the area. Nevertheless, a call for help from the area came written on the usual dusty scroll, and so I made my preparations and headed off without delay.</p><br>
<p>It took a week by horse and cart to reach the Outlands from the castle town of Sprigsbraeth; with each passing day the surrounding wilderness grew thicker and more sinister. I did not travel alone this time: my traveling companions were merchants who had decided that the potential of gold, gained by bringing supplies and tools to those living in the Outlands, was greater than any supposed danger that this famous region was rumored to hold. They had graciously offered me passage for free, and thus I did not plan to correct them on this misunderstanding.</p><br>
<p>I mostly kept to myself over the trip, thinking about the contract that had arrived and wondering from which plane this new &quot;adventure&quot; had come. Perhaps due to the length of the journey, the Eye started conversation with me a number of times more than what was usual.</p><br>
<p><em>I sense that movement between planes is common in this region.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;That would explain why there are so many rumors about the Outlands.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>Whether something has shifted to this plane recently, however, that is yet uncertain.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;We haven&#39;t arrived at our destination, anything that has shifted is probably still out of range.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>If you would draw me from the sheath, I would be better able to sense the energies of the area.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;You know very well the merchants wouldn&#39;t like me waving a big sword around for no reason. They&#39;d take it as a threat and send us away without hesitation.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>The merchants are of no consequence; you are trained in wilderness survival.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;Forgive me if I&#39;m not willing to make things harder on myself just to satiate your curiosity. We know where we&#39;re going, you can be patient until then.&quot;</p><br>
<p>Though greater in number, the conversations we had were no longer than usual.</p><br>
<p>Surprisingly, we made it to our destination without incident. The town was named Galvrick, after the knight of legend who had supposedly rid the Outlands of evil. By anyone&#39;s judgment, it did not appear that he had bothered to finish the task, and yet the town of Galvrick still stood as some semblance of a monument. In reality, it was a bleak collection of stone houses and buildings, with a large hall in its back corner and naught much else. In simple terms, Galvrick was a mass of gray, accented by the permanently cloudy sky.</p><br>
<p>I immediately headed towards the hall to consult about the contract. The Council had informed me that the request had been sent by the Lord of the Outlands, but beyond this information I was unaware of with whom I would be discussing, and of the exact nature of the issue to be solved. Apparently, the word &quot;rampaging&quot; had been used in excess.</p><br>
<p>As I approached the town hall, the large wooden doors of the entrance creaked open. I was expected, it seemed. I made my way inside; the interior was dim even by the standards of the gray afternoon outdoors, but I could make out some details from the limited torchlight. The room was obviously supposed to be furnished as a kind of combination banquet hall and throne room, but it lacked any of the splendor that one would expect from a successful example. The stone walls and pillars were chipped and crumbling, and many showed signs of moss growing in the crevices. The tapestries that hung limply on the walls were supposed to be lively decorations, but instead looked like the aftermath of some battle; torn, frayed, and faded to the point that the stories they depicted had probably long since been forgotten. The tables lining the sides of the room were damaged and old, as if the warriors who ate there had suddenly left for battle on more than one occasion. Combine this with the insufficient lighting and the processional rug that was a hideous shade of purple, and the hall felt more like a dungeon.</p><br>
<p>I progressed slowly on through the hall, and as my eyes adjusted to the damp darkness, the occupants of the hall came into vision like specters. Men and women, dressed more like warriors than subjects, stared at me unblinkingly, giving off an atmosphere of uneasiness. Some of them might have been the Lord&#39;s knights; regardless, it seemed that everyone needed to be prepared for battle at any moment in the Outlands. I continued my progression, doing my best to appear unfazed by their non-welcome. The number of my spectators increased gradually as I continued towards the end of the hall, eventually becoming a small party in size. I reached my destination to find a large and simplistic throne, lacking any meaningful carvings or insets, and made of stone and wood. Its occupant was an older man, not yet weakened by time but nonetheless visibly worn by it. As I came into his presence, the uneasiness I felt from the others was immediately magnified. A combination of faded silks and furs and a dull iron diadem made it apparent that this man was in some sense a ruler, but the mismatched armor and broadsword at his side revealed that his true role was that of a soldier.</p><br>
<p>He stared at me with tired but unwavering eyes as I approached. I stopped at what I deemed to be the appropriate distance, and out of custom gave a bow. After a short pause, he spoke in a deep, raspy voice.</p><br>
<p>&quot;Am I correct to assume that you are whom they call &#39;the Hand of the Council?&#39;&quot;</p><br>
<p>&quot;Indeed, my Lord,&quot; I responded. &quot;Your contract was received by the Council a fortnight prior, and thus I was dispatched immediately. I offer sincere apologies for my delay.&quot;</p><br>
<p>His facial expression remained unchanged, but I watched his eyes flit back and forth as he analyzed my person. After a few moments, he spoke again.</p><br>
<p>&quot;Your stature is far less assuming than that of one I would expect to hold a position as impactful as yours.&quot;</p><br>
<p>I felt my blood pressure rise by a few degrees.</p><br>
<p>&quot;I would be loath to not meet your expectations, my lord, but I am who you call &#39;the Hand of the Council.&#39;&quot;</p><br>
<p>He gave a half-hearted sniffle as a response and continued.</p><br>
<p>&quot;I am Duke Corthing, the ruler of this area often called &#39;the Outlands.&#39; Those who choose to live here are under my protection, and though these lands have many dangers, we are resilient to stand against them and make our lives.&quot;</p><br>
<p>The Duke paused slightly and glanced at me with a look that conveyed just how unwelcome I was to him.</p><br>
<p>&quot;To face a problem for which our strength is insufficient is rare, speaking mildly, and I assure you that our call to the Council was made with no small amount of deliberation. I trust that said call was not made in vain.&quot;</p><br>
<p>I gave my retort without thought.</p><br>
<p>&quot;My Lord, by the command of the Council I have already been in countless battles. While the rumors of what lurks in the Outlands are terrifying to the old ladies in Sprigsbraeth, my experience goes beyond larger-than-average spiders and the especially nasty raider clan.&quot;</p><br>
<p>The duke&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;Were the problem any of those trifles, we would not have bothered contacting the Council at all.&quot;</p><br>
<p>The atmosphere of the room tensed slightly; I was sure that the warriors were waiting to see if their leader would lose patience and call for my death. The Duke, however, chose to continue his explanation.</p><br>
<p>&quot;As I explained in the contract provided, within the last two months, several of the villages under my rule have been attacked in the night. Each time, unprecedented damage was done to the houses and walls, and all victims were either killed en masse or dragged off, never to be seen again.&quot;</p><br>
<p>I interjected, &quot;and this is for certain not a rival clan from the north?&quot;</p><br>
<p>The Duke eyed me slightly. &quot;We do not know what it is.&quot;</p><br>
<p>He stood from his throne; he was taller than I had expected, and it was obvious that he commanded respect from those over whom he ruled. As he spoke, he began to pace back and forth, more focused on his own words than on me.</p><br>
<p>&quot;These attacks,&quot; he continued, &quot;are unlike anything we have ever seen. Were it a party of raiders or some foreign army, there would be evidence of their presence and retreat, but we have yet to find any hint of such. In addition, what baffles me and my warriors to this extent is damage done.&quot;</p><br>
<p>His last few words caught my attention. &quot;The damage, my Lord?&quot;</p><br>
<p>The duke&#39;s face shifted from tired resilience to true perplexity. &quot;One home is burnt to ashes from fire, and the home next door is coated in ice. The villagers in each village say they saw countless lightning strikes, despite no storm being present on any of those nights. Guard towers and dining halls alike are crushed as if they were made of mere straw. And still,&quot; he paused, clearly unsure of what to make of his own words,&quot; no one can say for certain what has been attacking these villages.&quot;</p><br>
<p>I was thoroughly convinced at this point that something had indeed shifted from one of the planes.</p><br>
<p>&quot;Thus, I am requesting you to investigate the source of these attacks, and,&quot; he once again eyed me with plenty of disdain, &quot;if you are qualified for it, to handle the matter definitively.&quot;</p><br>
<p>At that point I let my emotions get the better of me once more. &quot;My Lord, I can assure you that the Council of Mages sends me with confidence in my ability to meet expectations, regardless of how stratospheric they may be.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>It is unnecessary to goad the client in such a manner.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m not goading him,&quot; I directed my thoughts towards the Eye, &quot;I&#39;m simply providing answers to his concerns.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>You are doing both simultaneously. This is not the first time a client has been disrespectful; you can practice restraint.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;He&#39;s the one who called for assistance. It isn&#39;t my fault if he doesn&#39;t understand the position in which he finds himself currently.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>It will be your fault if the contract is ended and a bounty is put on your head.</em></p><br>
<p>The Eye has always had a habit of interjecting with unwanted objectivity.</p><br>
<p>I looked at the Duke, who was clearly close to finding a reason to call for my beheading. &quot;I will without hesitation begin the investigation, my Lord. The moment I discover the source of these attacks, I will employ all of my power to prevent any future instances of their happening.&quot;</p><br>
<p>The Duke&#39;s eyes narrowed once again. After a pause, he made his final statement. &quot;We have prepared a room for you in the local inn. You may spend the night there if you so wish. Please be aware that the master of the property will expect payment.&quot;</p><br>
<p>Based on the prior input of the Eye, I chose to bite my tongue this time, and instead gave one last bow before taking my leave.</p><br>
<p>The following morning, I awoke early and made my way to the most recent location of the attacks, a small village further north. The moment that the village&#39;s perimeter wall came into view, it was obvious that this was indeed no raider attack.</p><br>
<p><em>You are not aware of any magic that can make a hole, a perfect circle no less, in stone that thick, correct?</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;I thought you were supposed to be the expert on said subject; I&#39;m just the muscle.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>Our respective roles are well defined, but I believe this sight is new to both of us.</em></p><br>
<p>The Eye was correct; whatever had blasted those holes through the guard wall had power not yet seen on this plane, let alone by either of us.</p><br>
<p>I entered the village unimpeded; there were no guards present to ask of my reason for visiting. As I progressed into the destruction, it became clear that very few people were left in the village at all. Occasionally someone could be seen, either tending to an injury or huddled in shock, but they were few and far between. However, without going into excessive detail, there was no shortage of corpses.</p><br>
<p>The visible damage was immeasurable: houses demolished and burnt; holes like those in the wall visible throughout the town. Pillars of ice pointed in jagged directions, just as the Duke had said, and they appeared so out of place, it was as if they had pierced upward from the ground below. As I surveyed the wreckage with each step, I could not imagine what could have caused this kind of destruction, but I knew that not only was it something not from this plane, but that it was also immensely powerful.</p><br>
<p>After a few minutes of walking, I reached the center of the village and found an old man sitting next to the remains of some sort of speaking pedestal. He was obviously on in years, and his silver hair and beard were at a length that conveyed both wisdom and a lack of desire to self-maintain. He also wore similar armor and clothing to the Duke, though it was simpler in design and far more worn; I surmised that he was the leader of this village, or what was left of it. He did not look up at me as I approached.</p><br>
<p>&quot;Have you come to pass final judgment on this village, ye angel of death?&quot;</p><br>
<p>I was surprised by the question. &quot;I am the representative for the Council of the Magic-Bearers, and am currently employed by the Duke Corthing, arm of his Majesty, to research the incidents that have occurred in this area as of late.&quot;</p><br>
<p>The old man snorted slightly. &quot;&#39;Incidents.&#39; Were this a mere incident, I would not be praying for my own death as we speak.&quot;</p><br>
<p>I chose not to dwell on his misery, and instead continued. &quot;Were you witness to anything on the day of the attack? Any information at all would be of utmost use to me.&quot;</p><br>
<p>After a heavy sigh, the old man began to speak. &quot;It was a pitch-black night. Our watch was in the middle of shifting posts, which is probably why we did not know what would happen until it was too late. Rumors of a raiding party approaching had put us on edge, but we were confident we would catch them before they arrived. I was waiting with some of the warriors of this village at the south end of the perimeter wall; I had made the decision to position our forces such that response to any call would be quick and efficient.&quot;</p><br>
<p>A look of pain and grief crossed the old man&#39;s face. &quot;Those men were doomed to their deaths by my hand.&quot;</p><br>
<p>For the first time since he had spoken, he raised his eyes to look at me. They were a deep silver, and held years of wisdom an experience, but also a pain that I could tell would never go away.</p><br>
<p>&quot;Something large and glowing mounted the wall right next to us and sent fifty of those poor boys flying with no struggle whatsoever.&quot;</p><br>
<p>One particular word caught my attention. &quot;Did you say &#39;glowing?&#39;&quot;</p><br>
<p>The old man nodded. &quot;A stripe of bright blue, like the bluest sky in summer, and one of red, like the setting sun, ran down the thing&#39;s back, each made up of jagged spikes.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>We are facing something with inherent elemental power, and probably no smarter than the average beast.</em></p><br>
<p>I ignored the Eye for the time being. &quot;I sympathize with the shock you must have felt in that moment.&quot;</p><br>
<p>The old man bowed his head again. &quot;I didn&#39;t get another good look at it, but it tore through this village like a spider web and left with no resistance. We spent all night listening to the screams of those who had been its wake.&quot;</p><br>
<p>I had no desire to press the issue any further, but I needed to confirm what I had been told by the Duke and what my own eyes had seen. &quot;The ice pillars, and those holes in the perimeter wall; this thing caused them?&quot;</p><br>
<p>&quot;Yes, as well as the fires that burned down houses and the poor souls inside them.&quot; He pointed a rugged hand towards the largest hole. &quot;Each attack was devastating, but the worst were the beams of light that erased everything they touched.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>No light element exists as far as the Council is aware. We will have to investigate in detail.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;If you do not mind one final question,&quot; I continued, &quot;do you know in which direction the attacker fled after its rampage?&quot;</p><br>
<p>The old man looked north. &quot;There is a great forest just north of this village. Local knowledge is that death becomes more certain the deeper you travel into it, but whatever brought judgment on us that night, it entered that forest without second thought.&quot; Each word seemed to sap more power from the old man, as if he paid with his life to speak. &quot;Horrible things sometimes wander out from those trees, but nothing like this.&quot;</p><br>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s hiding in the forest,&quot; I directed my thoughts to the Eye. &quot;We will most likely have to chase it out to either send it back or slay it.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>Time is of the essence, as I am sure you are aware. We have no time to collect further knowledge on this forest, or what other threats exist in its depths.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;Thank you very much for your help,&quot; I concluded as I turned back towards the village gate. My instinct to offer further assistance was ignored; I had a greater job as my focus.</p><br>
<p>I immediately headed north and entered the forest. While it was obvious that this expanse of trees was large, I was quickly surprised by just how deep it seemed to stretch. Before long, it became difficult to tell the sun&#39;s position, and I lost all sense of time. The Eye provided periodic directional clues based on the pulses felt in the area, but I became more worried about finding my way out than locating the source of the attacks.</p><br>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity of searching, the Eye gave a new statement.</p><br>
<p><em>We are close.</em></p><br>
<p>We had arrived at a cliff face that stretched up into the mountains. The jagged stone looked as if it were jutting out from the mossy ground, like a natural barrier.</p><br>
<p>&quot;I would wager that it&#39;s hiding in a cave somewhere to protect itself from threats.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>I postulate differently. Did you not notice how we encountered no other threats or creatures during our search?</em></p><br>
<p>I had not, but the realization from the Eye&#39;s statement caused the blood to drain from my face.</p><br>
<p><em>The creature that has shifted over is more powerful than any other threat living in this forest, which is why they themselves are in hiding. Furthermore,</em></p><br>
<p>I felt the air around me begin to sizzle with heat.</p><br>
<p><em>The reason we are close is simple: you are being hunted.</em></p><br>
<p>I dodged out of the way just as hurtling flames licked my face. For the first time this contract, I drew the Eye from its sheath, and faced my attacker.</p><br>
<p>A giant lizard-like creature, a full house in height and at least three in length, eyed me hungrily. Its scales were a dull gray, but its eyes flashed a brilliant yellow, almost white in hue. On both sides of its back ran a ridge of crystal-like growths; the left a bright blue, and the right a deep red. They pulsated with light, as if they were continuously creating energy.</p><br>
<p>The lizard flicked its tongue, seemingly surprised that I wasn&#39;t already burnt to a crisp. Then, with no ceremony whatsoever, it made a dash for me. On reflex, I threw out my hand towards my feet and incited the Gale of Acrophos enchantment; immediately I was launched into the air and hurtled towards the canopy.</p><br>
<p>I may have saved myself from death in that moment, but the lizard was not to be deterred. With no hesitation, it leaped after me and opened its mouth. In that moment, the blue range of crystals began to shine with a new intensity, and from the lizard&#39;s gaping maw came a blue bolt. I quickly blocked with the Eye, and it ricocheted into the trees, turning into ice as it slammed into one.</p><br>
<p><em>As expected, it has elemental control over both ice and flame. You must be careful.</em></p><br>
<p>I grabbed a tree branch at the last moment and swung to the opposite side, momentarily hiding myself from my hunter.</p><br>
<p>&quot;It wouldn&#39;t hurt to use &#39;we&#39; instead of &#39;you&#39; in situations, &quot; I commented in a brief pause.</p><br>
<p><em>I am under no threat of death; &#39;you&#39; is sufficient.</em></p><br>
<p>The tree beneath me shuddered as the lizard latched on to its trunk. Another bolt of ice ripped through the wood, and I had to jump away to avoid the flying debris. I incited Gale of Acrophos on my feet again, this time to soar off and gain distance from the monster. I then switched to the Wings of the Purveyors enchantment and flew off through the trees, in an effort to make tailing me as difficult as possible. Looking back revealed how futile the effort was: the lizard was sprinting after me with a nimbleness that made the forest a non-issue.</p><br>
<p><em>The sending ritual will be too difficult to complete in this state; your best option is to slay the target.</em></p><br>
<p>I swerved to the right as a fireball incinerated the tree next to me and continued my retreat. The idea of getting into direct combat with the creature seemed tantamount to suicide. &quot;If I can find any kind of clearing whatsoever, the sending ritual becomes possible; there has to be a place in this forest where the foliage is thinner.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>The beast is too fast to make use of a space such as that effectively. I recommend utilizing Steps of the Planesguide and attacking its weak spot.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;Teleportation? You know I only just recently mastered that enchantment; I&#39;ve never used it while moving!&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>The Council deemed your performance satisfactory, and their permission denotes that you are capable to use the enchantment in any scenario.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;I am <strong>not</strong> putting myself in the middle of a tree just to try to be fancy in killing this thing!&quot;</p><br>
<p>I looked back once again. The lizard was still following me, but its eyes had started to glow with a brighter yellow than usual. In addition, both ridges of crystals began to shine simultaneously, increasing in brightness until the light mixed into the same yellow as the creature&#39;s eyes. Then, the beast opened its mouth again and fired a ray of white light directly at me.</p><br>
<p>Two thoughts crossed my mind in that moment: the Eye could most likely not block this attack, and I was looking at my own death once again.</p><br>
<p><em>Steps of the Planesguide.</em></p><br>
<p>In an instant I incited the enchantment, as if the Eye&#39;s words commanded me. With no resistance whatsoever I found myself twenty feet below where I had been a moment earlier, with all momentum still present. I made a quick dodge away from a jutting tree branch and continued flying.</p><br>
<p><em>A successful incitement; any fears you had about the enchantment while in motion should now be calmed.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;Why don&#39;t you focus on finding this thing&#39;s weak spot, instead of practicing your unique brand of sarcasm?&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>I have been analyzing the creature since it first appeared. Currently, I have calculated that the white light it just fired comes from mixing the elemental energies of both fire and ice, though I cannot say for certain how.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll be sure to remember that tidbit if we make it out alive!&quot;</p><br>
<p>The forest around me gradually became lighter as we progressed, meaning that we were moving with some speed towards its southern edge, where we had first entered. In addition, I could tell that continued use of enchantments was beginning to drain me of my strength. With any luck, the Eye would give me a solution in due speed, as leading the lizard back to the village was not an option, and I certainly did not want to become the lizard&#39;s next meal due to exhaustion.</p><br>
<p>Fireballs and ice pillars ricocheted around me as the beast did everything in its power to catch me. &quot;Why isn&#39;t it firing the light beam again?&quot; I gave a moment to ponder.</p><br>
<p><em>One possibility would be that it takes much of the beast&#39;s energy to fire, meaning that it could exhaust itself and lose the prey.</em></p><br>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m more than just prey, thank you, unless you want to become a lost treasure in this forest.&quot; I was not convinced; the holes we had seen in the walls of the village meant that the light beam had been fired many times on the night of the attack. So why was the lizard hesitating now?</p><br>
<p>As if to answer my question, the ridges on the beast&#39;s back began to gradate into yellow once again, and its eyes lit up. This time, however, I noticed another aspect of the preparation necessary for this attack: the lizard had stopped in its tracks and raised itself on its hind legs.</p><br>
<p>&quot;It has to aim,&quot; I realized. &quot;It can&#39;t just fire the beam; it has to ground itself and aim to safely use it.&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>I will add that I have completed my analysis. The most likely point of weakness is between the two ridges on the back, at the upper area of the spine.</em></p><br>
<p>Rather than responding, I immediately switched to the offensive. Canceling Wings of the Purveyors, I made contact with the closest tree and pushed off, immediately inciting the enchantment once again. All the while, the lizard kept its gaze locked on to me, preparing to wipe me from existence. I lined myself up with its open mouth and hurtled towards the beast with no hesitation.</p><br>
<p>A moment of eternity passed as we stared each other down. The lizard fired, and I incited Steps of the Planesguide. The beam flew past my head some five feet above, and I brandished the Eye, targeting the beast&#39;s stomach in front of me. With as much windup as I could muster, I slashed through the soft flesh; as I flew by, orange blood shot into the air and turned into flames mid-flight.</p><br>
<p>The lizard roared in pain, but I wasn&#39;t finished. As it went back down on all fours, I incited Steps of the Planesguide once more, appearing directly above the monster. I could feel that I was at the end of my strength, but it did not matter; the battle was over. A final break of all enchantments, and I began to plummet towards the creature&#39;s back, directly to where the Eye had identified its weak point. I could feel the heat and chill mixing in the air as I approached. The Eye began to glow with its usual white, the amethyst in its hilt shining from the illumination.</p><br>
<p>As soon as my feet touched the lizard&#39;s back, I plunged the Eye into its flesh. What should have been harder than rock split like bread from the Eye&#39;s enchantment; flames and ice crystals burst from the open wound. The lizard roared in agony again, and the two crystal ridges began to explode, the energy thus far contained within now needing an outlet. I held my position, with the Eye buried in the beast&#39;s back, unwavering as it thrashed about from the pain. Within moments the elemental explosions began to increase, bursting from other locations along the spine and multiplying the damage.</p><br>
<p>Judging that my work was finished, I made an unenchanted leap through a gap in the blue ridge to my right and went tumbling into the forest before the explosions could spell my end. With one final heave, the beast collapsed, dead from its own power; almost instantaneously its corpse both was set to flames and began to slowly freeze in places the heat did not reach.</p><br>
<p>As I took a moment to catch my breath, watched the spectacle play out in front of me. &quot;We&#39;ll have to bring back something as proof to the Duke. Do you think the head is too large?&quot;</p><br>
<p><em>It is reasonable to assume he would take said action as a threat.</em></p><br>
<p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh slightly at the light atmosphere after such a battle. In the end, I decided to take a crystal from each ridge, and a large claw from one of the feet.</p><br>
<p>The travel out of the forest proved to be uneventful, which was no small relief. As I emerged from the southern edge of the forest, I found an uncharacteristically clear sky displaying a beautiful setting sun. Near ecstatic to have made it back safely, I made my way back to the inn to spend a night of recuperation.</p><br>
<p>The following morning, I returned to the Duke and explained the situation as deeply as the Council&#39;s rules allowed. The discussion of the incident was uneventful, but I could tell that my return and success were both sources of surprise. Nevertheless, I received my payment and immediately made my leave.</p><br>
<p>On my trip back to Sprigsbraeth, I gave thought once again to which plane from which the lizard had originated; I had seen nothing like it thus far, and no records of said creature were located in the Council&#39;s archives. My report would certainly prove to be a point of interest to the Council, I thought at the time, but due to my need to slay the beast out of self-defense, I would unfortunately be unable to provide anything other than the trophies I had taken as items of research.</p><br>
<p>As I write this, the Council is most likely researching the contents that I provided. Thankfully, the Magic-bearers were satisfied with them, few they may be, and I have been requested to take measures to provide more information should a similar creature shift over again. More than anything, I am sure the Council will be interested in learning how the mixing of elemental energies works. It may prove to be of use for us as a source for our own enchantments, or some new weapon, in the future.</p><br>
<br><br><br>
